# nix-searchpkg
A rofi based interface to search Nix-OS packages on the go.

## Impetus

The standard way of fetching packages in NixOs is a bit tedious and opening a browser and manually searching for the desired packages seems a bit too klutzy, so here is a rofi based interface to select a channel and get the desired packages immediately.

## Requirements 

+ Rofi
+ Librewolf
+ Basic knowledge of NixOS
+ Enough mental retardation to use NixOS

## Usage
'''
$ git clone https://github.com/thewaywardlaureate/nix-searchpkg.git
$ cd nix-searchpkg/
$ chmod +777 nixsearchpkgs.sh
$ ./nixsearchpkgs.sh
'''

## Notes

It is recommended to bind the script to some keybind in order to make your workflow a lot more fluid.
